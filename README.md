# Nashville_Real_Estate
In the dynamic world of real estate investment, we're gearing up for an exciting venture in the thriving Nashville market. Armed with a dataset detailing recent property sales, the mission is to craft predictive models that decode the Sale Price Compared to Value â€“ a pivotal metric in gauging property valuation. Kicking off the journey, a meticulous data cleansing process ensured our analytical foundation was rock solid, addressing missing values and outliers. We then delved into a Linear Regression model to unveil the driving factors behind housing prices, followed by a nuanced exploration with a Decision Tree model. Strengthening our analytical toolkit, the Random Forest model provided ensemble insights, and the Gradient Boosting model fine-tuned our predictions. This strategic approach aims to equip our real estate company with a comprehensive toolkit for identifying prime value deals during our imminent visit to the bustling Nashville scene.
